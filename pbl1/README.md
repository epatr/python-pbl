## Problem: 7/11 Doubles

For this project, you are going to write a Python program that simulates playing the 7/11 Doubles game.

The program will simulate rolling a pair of dice (use a random number generator to do this). If the sum of the dice is 7 or 11 or if the same number is shown on both dice (a double), the player wins. Otherwise the player loses.
