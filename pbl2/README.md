 * Create two lists
    * guest name
    * food
 
 * Populate the food list with some examples
 
 * Prompt the user if they'd like to add or remove a guest, or print the list out
 * If add: 
   * Prompt the user for a name, and have them choose a food from the examples
   * Add the food/name to a dict
   * If they choose a food that already has a guest attached to it, have them * choose again
 * If remove:
   * Remove the food/name from the lists
